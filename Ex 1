           A deer or true deer is a hoofed ruminant mammal of the family Cervidae. The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including muntjac, elk (wapiti), red deer, and fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, roe deer, and moose. Male deer of all species (except the water deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this, they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla).


 <br></p>
        <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;color:gray;font-size: 15px">  The musk deer (Moschidae) of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families that are also in the ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not especially closely related to Cervidae.

        <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;color:gray;font-size: 15px">
Deer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings onwards, and they have played a role in mythology, religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry, such as red deer that appear in the coat of arms of Åland.[2] Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their skins as soft, strong buckskin, and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer hunting has been a popular activity since the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today

            Elephants are the largest living land animals. <br></p>
        <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;color:gray;font-size: 15px">   Three living species are currently
            recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant
            (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).<br></p>
        <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;color:gray;font-size: 15px">  They are the only surviving members
            of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and
            mastodons. <br></p>
            <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;color:gray;font-size: 15px">Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks,
            large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile,
            bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects.<br></p>
            <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;color:gray;font-size: 15px">Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.<br>
                The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.<br></p>
            <p style="font-family: Lucida Console;color:gray;font-size: 15px">African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller
            ears and convex or level backs.</P>
